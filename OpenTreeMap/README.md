This is the OTM library, you should also have a checkout of the OTM Example Implementation.  The
example implementation references the library, and contains the main configuration.  This configuration
includes values in:
    1) res/defaults.xml
    2) res/configuration.xml 
        * With settings to match OTM website
        * With choices built from choices.py using fabric script.
    3) buildconf.example, which the fabric file will use to build your project

The file structure of your checkouts should be:
    /projects
        /otm (this repo)
        /yourImplementation (a clone of the Example Implementation project modified for your app.)
